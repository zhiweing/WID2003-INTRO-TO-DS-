Sleep health analysis

Our project focuses on analyzing sleep patterns, considering both health and lifestyle factors. We've utilized a dataset sourced from Kaggle, comprising a total of 400 rows and 13 columns. These columns contain diverse information including gender, age, occupation, sleep duration, sleep quality, physical activity level, stress levels, BMI category, blood pressure, heart rate, daily steps, and the presence or absence of sleep disorders.
